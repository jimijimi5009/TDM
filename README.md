# Test Data Management

A tool to generate realistic test data for your projects.

## Development

To run the project locally, follow these steps:

1.  **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

2.  **Start the development server**:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

3.  Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8080` (or the address shown in your terminal).

## Building for Production

To create a production build, run:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will create a `dist` folder with the optimized and minified files.
